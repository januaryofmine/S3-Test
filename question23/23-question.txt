In technical, we cannot say that which framework is the best.
In different cases, with different resources such as time, people, ..., there couldnt be one solution for any cases.

In technical, we need to find silver bullet for each requirements.

So now, I will compare framework and when we will choose it.
Angular vs React

There are tons of articles & talk about comparision in deeply technical
    https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/angular-vs-vue-vs-react/
    https://blog.logrocket.com/angular-vs-react-vs-vue-a-performance-comparison/

So now, I would talk about my personal view when initial a new project: 
    I would choose Angular if project:
        + Large scale in business features (not technical features).
        + Not too much complex in state between each component.
        + Requirements technical Typescript or backend with NestJS.
        + No need in structure codebase.
        + If that project is Web admin
    
    I would choose React if project:
        + Need to develop and go live fast.
        + Deeply customize each component.
        + Need to integrate with old project.
        
=> Nowsaday, I believe 80% what can do in Angular that can do in React.
So basicly, mostly I focus on time & people when initial new project.
What kind of technical that my team more familiar & how long the project would be.

Moreover, thanks for micro-frontend, we could choose different framework or libs frontend
for different component in websites.
